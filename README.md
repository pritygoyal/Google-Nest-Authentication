Google Nest API Documentation and Examples

Welcome to the Google Nest API documentation and examples! This code is for developers looking to seamlessly integrate their applications with Google Nest devices. With the Google Nest API, you can unlock the potential of controlling, monitoring, and interacting with smart home devices.

Introduction
The Google Nest API opens doors to a world of possibilities by allowing developers to create applications that harness the power of Google Nest smart home devices. These devices offer a wide range of functionalities, and this API enables you to tap into these features programmatically.

Getting Started
Ready to dive into the Google Nest API? Here's how you can get started:

Create a Google Developers Project: If you haven't already, head over to the Google Developers Console and create a new project. Enable the "Nest Device Access" API for your project.

Generate API Credentials: You'll need OAuth 2.0 credentials for your project. These credentials will serve as the key to authenticating your application with the Google Nest API. Also make sure to download and place the client secret json file in src/main/resources/keys folder.

Install Dependencies: Depending on your preferred programming language, you may need to install the necessary libraries or packages to facilitate API requests. 

Authentication: Learn how to authenticate your application by following the authentication process outlined in the dedicated section.

Explore API Endpoints: Once your authentication is set up, you're ready to start making requests to various API endpoints, allowing you to communicate with Google Nest devices.

Authentication
Secure your application's access to the Google Nest API using these steps:

Obtain OAuth 2.0 Credentials: Create OAuth 2.0 client credentials within your Google Developers Console project.

Authorization Code Flow: Implement the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow in your application. This process involves redirecting users to Google's authentication page for granting access.

Exchange Authorization Code: Upon user approval, exchange the received authorization code for both an access token and a refresh token.

API Requests: Incorporate the access token into your API request headers to ensure secure and authenticated communication.
